Test Part

The logic behind this testing section is to ensure the normal operation of the E-Business Event Management System under various scenarios. We have adopted the Functional Testing approach, where different scenarios and test cases are used to verify whether the system's various functions work as expected.
Specifically, the logic is as follows:
Testing Scenarios: We have defined several testing scenarios, each representing a common operation or function within the system. These scenarios include creating events, registering participants, displaying loyalty points, generating event reports, and collecting feedback.
Test Cases: Within each testing scenario, we have listed one or more specific test cases. Each test case includes input data and the expected output results.
Test Data: We have provided specific input data examples, such as event names, dates, participant names, etc. These data serve as sample inputs for testing the system's functionality.
Expected Results: For each test case, we have clearly defined the expected output results. These results are what we expect the system to produce given the provided input.
Test Conclusion: Finally, we have summarized the entire testing process and drawn conclusions, indicating whether the system operates as expected after testing. In this example, we have concluded that the system performs normally in all its functions.
